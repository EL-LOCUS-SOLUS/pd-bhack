# `bhack` - the _b-side_ hack of the BACH library for Pd

`v0.0.0-alpha-0`

## About: 

This is a family of objects inspired by the BACH library for MAX, which deal with "llll" (lisp-like linked lists). 

It relies on [pdlua](https://github.com/EL-LOCUS-SOLUS/pd-lua) to manage this new data type. 

This is supposed to be incorporated into the ELSE library, which supports externals written in lua.
